# Chatnow
This is a simple chat application built using express.js and socket.io \
It has a general room where everyone can chat and also supports private messaging

I tried to make it as simple as possible so there are only minimal features. \
There is no data stored on the server so once you close a tab you lose all your messages \
There's no fluff and it does just what it says. It allows you to *Chatnow*
